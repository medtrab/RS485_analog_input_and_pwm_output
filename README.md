
# RS485 Example on Mbed OS 6 with the use if ADC reading PWM output


You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)

1. [Install Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).



## Application functionality

The `main()` function is the single thread in the application. It send data through serial RS485 with adc reading of voltage on pin A0 and ajust PWM output according to the adc input and also sending duty cycle.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
2. <a name="build_cmd"></a> Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:
    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.

Depending on the target, you can build the example project with the `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR` toolchain. After installing Arm Mbed CLI, run the command below to determine which toolchain supports your target:

```bash
$ mbed compile -S
```
